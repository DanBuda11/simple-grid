# Simple Grid

A very simple grid system. No bells or whistles. Just a responsive grid in under 30 lines of CSS.

* Breakpoints for mobile, tablet, and desktop
* Option to choose 3 or 4 columns max for wider screens
* Works whether or not grid elements have borders

### To Use

* For SASS, copy the content of the main.scss file into your own .scss file and use the class names in your code as desired
* for CSS, do the same as above but with the main.css file
