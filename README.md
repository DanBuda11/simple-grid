# Simple Grid

A very simple grid system. No bells or whistles. Just a responsive grid.

* Mobile: single column
* Tablet: 2 columns
* Desktop: option of 3 or 4 columns with instructions to change desired max-width

### To Use

* For SASS, copy the content of the main.scss file into your own .scss file and use the class names in your code as desired
* for CSS, do the same as above but with the main.css file
